### What are the Jack & Jill competition levels?

For this edition of Citadel Swing we are only offering two JnJ competition levels: Newcomer & Novice. 

If enough Intermediate / Advanced Dancers register, we will extend the competition levels.

### How many songs will we dance to in the Jack & Jill competition?

You will get 3 songs. You will rotate randomly before each song.

### When / what is Marshalling?

The Jack & Jill competition starts on Saturday, 19:00 with Marshalling!

We will post the heats in time so you know when you have to participate.

We will place you in the right order and the whole heat marches onto the dance floor at once. This will help us be on time.
