### How do I check-in / register / get my wrist band?

You will need to show some form of valid ID when you register, because your tickets are tied to your name.

If you are not registered, you can do so on the spot. Please refer to the registration desk in the entrance hall. 

If you have questions regarding the on-line registration process, don't hesitate to contact us anytime. We are glad to help.
