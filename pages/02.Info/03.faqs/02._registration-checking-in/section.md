### How do I check-in / register / get my wrist band?

If you have registered online, please bring your Tickets in either digital (Eventbrite mobile app) or physical (printed) form. This will make our check-in process much easier and faster. 

If you are not registered, you can do so on the spot. Please refer to the registration desk in the entrance hall. 

If you have questions regarding the online registration process, don't hesitate to contact us anytime. We are glad to help.
