### How do I make sure I don't damage the dance floor?

Please take care of our dance floor by using a pair of dancing shoes which you don't use outside.

Don't bring in any chairs, tables, food, drinks, cigarettes or dance talc and please don't use metal heels.

**Thank you!**

### Can I bring drinks on the dance-floor?

Please **do not** bring any drinks on the dance floor, it's dangerous for everyone dancing who may slip on a spilled drink and hurt themselves.

Any drinks found on the dance floor will be removed by the staff immediately.

Thank you for understanding.
