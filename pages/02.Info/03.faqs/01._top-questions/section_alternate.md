### What's this about a Guided Tour?

We are organizing 2 guided tours of 2 hours each through the historical city center of Timisoara, with [the best local Tour Guide](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298478-d7211668-Reviews-Timisoara_Tour_Guide-Timisoara_Timis_County_Western_Romania_Transylvania.html?target=_blank).
The first will be on Friday and the second on Monday, both starting at 13:55 from [this location](https://goo.gl/maps/97sA2K6Ynor?target=_blank).

The price is 5 EUR per person, not included in the pass price, payable at the start of the tour, directly to the tour guide.

### What's with the Knight with Shining Armour Themed Competition?<a id="group-discounts"></a>

The rules will be announced on the spot. Keep that tension rising ... >:)

### Do you offer Group Discounts?

Yes we do. Details are as follows:
 - a group of 10 people gets 10% discount for pass prices
 - a group of 15 people gets 15% discount for pass prices
 - a group of 20+ people gets 15% discount for pass prices + a free party pass

**Important!** These group discounts are automatically applied by our payment system. In order for this to work, the group must be registered by the group leader in one transaction. You can add multiple Tickets to your order, it's like online shopping :-)

If you have any questions regarding this, don't hesitate to contact Andrei or Lumi directly.
