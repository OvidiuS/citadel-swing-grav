Workshops are amazing! You improve your technique and learn new moves. Learning is the first part however, we all know that practice makes perfect and what better way to practice than a party? Or actually three parties!

### Friday's Party

The first will be on Friday where you can take the opportunity to meet your colleagues for the next few days.

### Themed Saturday's Party

The second party will be on Saturday and in order to spice things up a little, it will be Medieval Themed. We don't expect you to have medieval clothing in your wardrobe, so don't get out of your way to purchase some. Feel free to get creative with what you have: corsettes, vests & other stuff. We still want this party to be a memorable one, so we will provide a few props and costumes which you can use to take pictures.

### Sunday's Party

The third and last party of the event will be on Sunday. Use this opportunity to dance until the sun comes up and share contacts with your new friends, you will deffenitely meet them at other events, so stay in touch. :-)
