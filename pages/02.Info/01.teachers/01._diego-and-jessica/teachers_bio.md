Diego and Jessica live in Fortaleza, Brazil. Diego has a degree in Physical Education and a Graduate Degree in Dance Teaching Methodology. Jessica has a degree in Accounting. Passion for dance has inspired the strong partnership between Diego and Jessica, and has been spreading West Coast Swing in Brazil and around the world since 2009, when they began to put all its charm to its first steps in the WCS.

Diego and Jessica have also been putting a lot of effort into developing and spreading Zouk, one of the most widespread dances in Brazil which has been growing. Today they travel through Europe, America, Asia, and Brazil to teach, perform, judge, and compete annually in many events around the world.

Since 2014, the couple have been promoting The Brazilian Open Championships, the main West Coast Swing event in Brazil (joined in the World Swing Dance Council), and are the creators of the West Coast Swing Day free event with the goal to spread WCS in Brazil and worldwide.
