Natively from Czech Republic & Reunion Island, Jakub and Em took their first steps into the dance world at the age of 16 and 12, both starting with Ballroom Dancing (Latin, Standard & line-dancing). 

After her arrival in France at the age of 18, as Em sought to start a new dance form, she bumped into a video of Jordan & Tatiana and fell in love with WCS right away. Being trained by Maxence Martin, gave her access to solid knowledge which she later used to develop her own dancing and teaching style. Today she acts in the WCS Community not only as a teacher but also as a DJ and photographer.

Jakub's dance world consists of social dances such as Zouk, WCS and Salsa but there is also a part of solo or group Modern and Contemporary dances. He started to dance and compete in WCS in 2014, guided mainly by Maxence Martin and Mario Robau, while using a lot of his background knowledge in his approach. His philosophy in dance is focused on communication. Nowadays he lives in Brno, teaching, dancing, choreographing and competing.

They were both hooked since they discovered WCS and were especially drawn to the creativity, musicality and freedom within the dance. They first started teaching together in a styling workshop in June 2016, thanks to Adam and Rita. At the end of the weekend the students suggested that they should partner up, so they did :D
