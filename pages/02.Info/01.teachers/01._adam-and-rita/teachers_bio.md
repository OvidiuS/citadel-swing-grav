Adam and Rita first started teaching Boogie-Woogie together in 2002.

They also competed that year and became Hungarian Champions. Many of their students became Hungarian Champions themselves and were successful even internationally. Some of them are still teaching and developing the Boogie community in Hungary.

Adam and Rita fell in love with West Coast Swing during a demo class in Munich, 2007. After that they sought every opportunity to learn more and more. One year later, mostly to the gentle push of around 60 of their students, they started teaching it. Very soon Adam and Rita had to give up Boogie teaching completely to have the time and focus to build the Hungarian West Coast Swing Community.

Together, they now teach 7 different weekly classes, from beginner to competitor levels. The couple is invited all over Europe, from France to Russia multiple times yearly to share their knowledge and experience.

Adam and Rita organize the biggest West Coast Swing events in Hungary: BudaFest and Hungarian Open. These are recognized by the World Swing Dance Council and bring together top teachers from all over the world. They are very proud of having built a Hungarian West Coast Swing Community that is among the 4 largest ones in Europe.
