**Nataliya** is an All-Stars level dancer from Ukraine, where she teaches and dances regularly. She is an upcoming WCS star in Europe who recently joined a new dance partnership with successful WCS professional from France, Ludovic Pelegrin. Aside from WCS, she has dance experience in Zouk, Tango and Salsa. In 2014, she won the European spin contest with a total of 61 spins. She is a talented spinner but also a risk taker on the social dance floor creating art through her dance movements every time.

Nowadays she continues to share her knowledge, passion and interesting dance philosophy in Ukraine and Europe. She is well-known for her lady's styling and spins/turns workshops.

**Ludovic** has taken his first dancing steps at 10 years old, when he first learned rock’n’roll. His dancing background is as much innovative as diversified, as he had taken a quick interest into Lindy-Hop, Balboa, Charleston, Acrobatic rock’n’roll, Salsa, Boogie Woogie and Tap dancing. 

He has been a Rock and Roll, Lindy Hop and Charleston instructor since 2009. His attraction into Swing dancing enabled him to discover West Coast Swing in 2010. 

Quickly becoming very passionate, he attended many workshops overseas where he learned from the best instructors. He regularly places in the Top 3 at the competitions he attends. He started to teach WCS since 2011, driven by the desire to share its passion and helping others to discover and learn it. 

After contributing to spreading West Coast Swing within his area (in France), he's now giving a few workshops across France and Europe. He is known for his amazing musical knowledge owing to experience and skill in a variety of dances, his structured and concise teaching and his great generosity.
