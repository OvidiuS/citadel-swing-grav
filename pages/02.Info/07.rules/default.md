We have cloakrooms where you can change. Makes sure to take your items with you when you are leaving for the classes.

The organizers will keep lost & found properties for one week after the event has finished.

### Physical Injury
There is a risk of physical injuries during dance activities. It is the participant's responsibility and decision to do any dance activity during the event. Do your best to be careful – for yourself and for the others as well!

The organizers do not take any responsibility for participants’ physical injuries.

### Decisions
Participants have to accept the decisions of the teachers and organizers during the event and especially during audition.

Participants (their image, voice) may appear in media (like photo, video, event DVD) that the organizers or representative will record during the event. The organizers can use these media files for any purpose related to Citadel Swing or other artistic purposes in any form. Participants agree that these media files are the sole property of the organizers.

### Refund
There is no refund in case some part of the program is not realized (for example a teacher is not participating because of illness or canceled flights).

### Recording
Participants are not allowed to record or take photos of classes, unless the teacher permits it.

### Dance floor etiquette
Please take care of our dance floor by using a pair of dancing shoes which you don't use outside.
Don't bring in any chairs, tables, food, drinks, cigarettes or dance talc and please don't use metal heels.

Please do not bring any drinks on the dance floor, it's dangerous for everyone dancing who may slip on a spilled drink and hurt themselves. Any drinks found on the dance floor will be immediately removed by the staff.
