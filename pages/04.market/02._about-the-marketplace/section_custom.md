## So What is this Marketplace About?

### Dancers
First of all, it's about you, the dancer! If you want to get that new pair of shoes or cool shirts and accessories, you will have the chance to browse through the available items.

### Creatives
Second of all, it's about you, the creative soul! If you personalize or distribute dancing shoes, clothing or accessories make the most of this opportunity and show them all off. Bring your stuff and we will make sure that you have a reserved spot to advertise & sell it.

There are no costs involved, we want you to keep all the profits. Please contact us as soon as you decide to participate in the marketplace, so that we can take care of the organisational aspects.

### Manufacturers
And last but not least, it's about them, our local manufacturers & partners. They all make our lives as dancers much easier and we feel that it is our responsibility to help them get to know you and your needs. Below you can find a list of partners who already confirmed their attendance to the Citadel Swing Marketplace.

**The Marketplace will be held on Sunday from 19:30 until 12:30**. See you there!
