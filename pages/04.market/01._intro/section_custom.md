Before being event organizers and West Coast Swing promoters, we were (and still are) dancers. As dancers we found it hard to find and purchase dance wear. We struggled to find the right pair of dancing shoes & clothing to complement us on the dancefloor. We thought of many ways to make this endeavour easier for us and for you, so the Marketplace is the best idea we had so far.
